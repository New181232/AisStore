AisWeb Track
=========
AisWeb Track is a simple REST based service to access realtime tracks of vessels by mmsi numbers.
It allows downsampling of tracks by duration and/or distance travelled.
And results can be outputted in either JSON or XML.

Getting Started
===============
A query for getting the last 30 minutes of position reports for a single vessel is as simple as invoking
http://cas2.sealan.dk:8080/track/123123123/json?interval=PT30m

If you want the output as xml you can change the url to
http://cas2.sealan.dk:8080/track/123123123/xml?interval=PT30m

The interval parameter is based on the standerdized ISO 8601 time interval. So for, for example, getting
all position report between 27. December 2012 11:30 CET and 28. December 2012 06:45 would result in a query like this

You can omit the interval parameter in which case you will get ALL the positions ever received
for the specified mmsi number.
http://cas2.sealan.dk:8080/track/123123123/json

As a general rule you always to specify an interval when querying to reduce the amount of data you receive.

Downsampling
========
To restrict the number of data returned you can downsample the result either by distance travelled or by time

To downsample the results so that you receive, for example, at most 1 point per minute you can use the
minDuration parameter.

http://cas2.sealan.dk:8080/track/123123123/json?interval=PT30m&minDuration=PT1m

Like the interval parameter the minDuration parameter is based on ISO 8601.

You can also downsample the result by the amount distance traveled. For example, to received at most
one position report for every 100 m you would call
http://cas2.sealan.dk:8080/track/123123123/json?interval=PT30m&minDistance=100

Notes
=========
Data is always sorted by time ascending. It is not currently possible to get in descending order
